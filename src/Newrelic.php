     * the application name ordering as described for that setting.
     *
     * The first application name is the primary name, and up to two extra application names can be specified (however
     * the same application name can only ever be used once as a primary name). This function should be called as early
     * as possible, and will have no effect if called after the RUM footer has been sent. You may want to consider
     * setting the application name in a file loaded by PHP's auto_prepend_file INI setting. This function returns true
     * if it succeeded or false otherwise.
     *
     * If you use multiple licenses you can also specify a license key along with the application name. An application
     * can appear in more than one account and the license key controls which account you are changing the name in.
     * If you do not wish to change the license and wish to use the third variant, simply set the license key to the
     * empty string ("").
     *
     * The xmit flag is new in version 3.1 of the agent. Usually, when you change an application name, the agent simply
     * discards the current transaction and does not send any of the accumulated metrics to the daemon. However, if you
     * want to record the metric and transaction data up to the point at which you called this function, you can specify
     * a value of true for this argument to make the agent send the transaction to the daemon. This has a very slight

     * false.
